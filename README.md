#### CMPT 353 Project

###### Project Description: 
We interested in the correlation between Covid-19 and Youtube trending videos. Our analysis is based on the following datasets:

- 2020 Daily Trending Youtube Videos      https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset
- 2018 Daily Trending Youtube Videos      https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new
- COVID-19 Daily Infections               https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases

The main questions we are want to answer from this data are:

1. Has COVID-19 affected Youtube trending videos in Canada, USA, and Great Britain?
We look at the number of trending video in each video category for two groups 
    1. Before the COVID-19 pandemic (year of 2018)
    2. During COVID-19 pandemic (year of 2020)

2. Has COVID-19 affected the ratio of likes versus views for the top trending videos in Canada, USA, and Great Britain?
We compare the ratio of likes versus views for the top trending videos in 2018 and 2020 and perform statistical analysis
to see if there is any significance.
