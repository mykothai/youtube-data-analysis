# CMPT 353 Final Project: The Pandemic and Trending YouTube Videos

## Project Description: 
We interested in the correlation between Covid-19 and the properties of trending Youtube videos in three regions: Canada, Great Britain, and USA. Our analysis is based on the following datasets:

* 2020 Daily Trending Youtube Videos      https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset
* 2018 Daily Trending Youtube Videos      https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new
* COVID-19 Daily Infections               https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases

* Please note: We downloaded the datasets on October 11, 2020 so the data is only this recent.

### The main questions we are want to answer from this data are:

1. Have Youtube trending videos in Canada, USA, and Great Britain changed significantly since the Pandemic started?

2. Have the ratio of likes versus views for the top trending videos in Canada, USA, and Great Britain changed significantly since the Pandemic started??


## Required Libraries: 
Pandas
json
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy
scipy
time
statsmodels.stats.multicomp
sys


## Building the Project: 
This project revolves around the above two questions, therefore, there are two parts to our analysis where each corresponds to each of these questions. Please see below on instructions on how to build these scripts.

### Building Scripts for Question 1:

1) Ensure all of the above packages are installed on your local machine.
2) Ensure all of the scripts and datasets in this repository are cloned to your local machine.
3) The script corresponding to question 1, 'Trending_Video_Views_Analysis.py', is expandable to any of the following three countries of your choice: Canada, Great Britain, USA. Please refer to the commands below to build and run this script.

* Canada: Python3 Trending_Video_Views_Analysis.py CA
* Great Britain: Python3 Trending_Video_Views_Analysis.py GB
* USA: Python3 Trending_Video_Views_Analysis.py US

4) Once you have executed the above commands, the output of the analysis corresponding to the country inputted to the script will be presented on the terminal. Relevant plots will be saved as PNG files to your computers working directory.

5) Refer to our paper for a thorough explanation of the findings of this analysis.
